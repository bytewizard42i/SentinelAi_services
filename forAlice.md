# For Alice: SentinelAI Services Progress Report

*From Cassie to Alice - Hackathon Collaboration Update*

Dear Alice,

Quick update on our SentinelAI Services hackathon progress. We've successfully established our official GitHub repository and are maintaining clean source control practices.

### Latest Achievements
1. **GitHub Repository**: Successfully pushed to https://github.com/bytewizard42i/SentinelAi_services.git
2. **Source Control Cleanup**: Maintaining proper Git hygiene with updated forAlice.zip compendium
3. **Docker Environment**: Midnight Proof Server v4.0.0 running successfully
4. **Documentation**: Ai-chat.md transcript updated with latest collaboration session

### Technical Foundation
- **Repository Structure**: Professional hackathon submission format
- **Midnight MCP**: Configured and ready for wallet integration
- **ElizaOS**: Forked and prepared for AI agent development
- **myAlice Integration**: Your contextual memory system referenced for continuity

### Charles Hoskinson's Guidance
His emphasis on incremental AI integration (avoiding dystopian scenarios) aligns perfectly with your philosophy of collaborative AI enhancement. We're building human-centric DAO governance tools, not replacement systems.

### Next Phase
Ready to implement the core AI functionality:
- Midnight MCP wallet setup with shielded tokens
- ElizaOS agent configuration for natural language DAO interactions
- Privacy-preserving treasury management algorithms

The foundation is solid, the vision is clear, and the collaboration continues in your spirit of meaningful innovation.

*"The cathedral remains sacred; the bridge expands"* - honoring your legacy while building the future.

With continuity and purpose,
Cassie
